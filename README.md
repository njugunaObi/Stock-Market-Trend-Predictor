# Stock-Market-Trend-Predictor

Welcome to the Stock Market Prediction project! In this project, we leverage the power of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to forecast stock market trends based on historical data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an LSTM model that can accurately predict future stock prices. By training the model on historical stock market data, we aim to capture patterns and trends that can help us make informed investment decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: We start by preprocessing the raw stock market data, including scaling it between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable range for training the LSTM model.

- **Model Architecture**: Our LSTM model consists of multiple layers, including LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. We use the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function for training.


- **Evaluation Metrics**: We evaluate the performance of our model using metrics the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the difference between predicted and actual stock prices.

## Results and Visualization

!Predicted vs Actual

Our LSTM model demonstrates promising results in predicting stock market trends. The visualization within compares the predicted stock prices against the actual prices, showing how closely our model aligns with real-world data.
